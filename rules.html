        <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
        <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
          youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
          team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
          this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
          background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

        <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong><p>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
            a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
            adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</p></li>
          <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS. </strong><p> Fields used within the competition program must be
            a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
            the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
            field may be required to play all their games away</p></li>
          <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong><ol id="abcd">
            <li> U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields
              for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>

            <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
